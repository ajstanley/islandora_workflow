This is a drupal module to implement a generic workflow around Fedora objects.

It uses an inline xml datastream to record the state of the workflow and notes associated with the workflow in workflow managed objects.
Acceptable state values: created, in_processing(for machine workflow), submitted, approved, published, rejected.

The module currently assumes that the 'islandora:collectionCModel' object acts as a parent for collection content models and not directly as a content model.
This can be changed via modifying 'collection_query.txt'.

Machine level workflow will be handled via fedora microservices.
Human level workflow will be handled through this drupal module.

Workflow can [not implemented yet] be enforced through the use of XACML. There is a settings toggle for this.

There are concurency issues, more info pending.
What happens when a Drupal admin revokes a permission that someone currently has with a collection?
How do we recover if Drupal side modifications occured when Fedora was inactive?

To be able to set user specific roles without restriction you need to set authenticated user permissions to include islandora_workflow_Submitter, islandora_workflow_Editor and islandora_workflow_Manager permissions.
Do not set the islandora_workflow_Administrator permission for the authenticated user role.
